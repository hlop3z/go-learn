# Welcome to Go-Learn

## [Read the Documents](https://hlop3z.github.io/go-learn/)

**Go-Learn** is my personal Go programming language notebook, built with the help of **MkDocs** (a Python tool to create static sites from Markdown). This project is designed to serve as a resource for myself and others to learn and experiment with Go, featuring notes, explanations, and examples.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following key components:

- **Notes**: A collection of useful notes, concepts, and tutorials for learning Go. These notes are organized into markdown files and rendered into a static site using **MkDocs**.
- **Examples**: A folder containing code examples that showcase various Go concepts and features. These examples are designed to help users understand how Go works in practice.

### Folder Structure

```plaintext
Go-Learn/
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ mkdocs.yml # MkDocs configuration file
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ examples/ # Go code examples folder
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ app_hello/main.go # A simple "Hello, World!" example
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ... # More Go examples
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ README.md # Project overview (this file)
```

## Features

- **Go Notes**: The `docs/` folder contains markdown notes, including explanations, code snippets, and Go programming tutorials.
- **Code Examples**: In the `examples/` folder, you'll find simple code examples that demonstrate Go's syntax and features, such as data structures, functions, loops, and more.

- **MkDocs**: The static site is built using the MkDocs tool, which generates a user-friendly website from Markdown files. The site is easy to navigate and allows you to browse through all the notes and examples seamlessly.

- **Learning Resources**: Whether youâ€™re a beginner or an advanced Go developer, youâ€™ll find useful insights and examples to help you understand Go and build practical applications.
