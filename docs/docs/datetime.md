# DateTime Utility

The **DateTime** utility ensures that all timestamps are retrieved in **UTC**. UTC is the standard for timekeeping in distributed systems and avoids issues related to time zones or daylight saving time.

---

## Features

- Retrieves the current time in **UTC**.
- Provides a straightforward implementation for consistent timekeeping.
- Easily integrates into other Go applications.

---

## Code

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

// DateTimeUTC returns the current time in UTC.
func DateTimeUTC() time.Time {
    return time.Now().UTC()
}

// Main function demonstrating the use of DateTimeUTC.
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Current UTC Time:", DateTimeUTC())
}
```

---

## How It Works

1. **UTC Time Retrieval**:  
   The `DateTimeUTC` function calls `time.Now()` and applies `.UTC()` to convert the local system time to **Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)**.

2. **Integration**:  
   This function can be imported into any Go project to ensure uniform time representation.

---

## Usage Example

```bash
$ go run main.go
Current UTC Time: 2024-11-29 14:45:02.123456789 +0000 UTC
```

---

## Best Practices

- **Use UTC for Logging**: UTC ensures that logs from different systems in various time zones are consistent and easy to correlate.
- **Avoid Local Time**: Avoid using `time.Now()` directly in distributed systems to prevent issues with time zone differences.
- **Integrate into APIs**: For APIs, always return timestamps in UTC to clients to avoid ambiguity.
