# Go `docstring`

The recommended approach in Go is to write the description in a **docstring** format, starting with a summary sentence on the first line, followed by more detailed explanations if needed. Here's an improved example with multi-line documentation:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// MaxAttempts defines the maximum number of allowed connection retries.
// This constant is used in scenarios where we need to ensure a limit
// on the number of attempts to avoid infinite retries in case of failure.
// It can be utilized in both client-side and server-side applications
// for handling retry mechanisms.
const MaxAttempts = 5

// User represents a basic user in the system. It includes an ID and Name,
// which are the essential attributes to identify and greet a user.
// This struct can be expanded to include more fields such as email,
// role, or other relevant user information as required by the application.
type User struct {
    ID   int    // User ID, a unique identifier for each user.
    Name string // User's name, which is used in greeting messages.
}

// Greet prints a personalized greeting message for the user.
// It accepts a User type as input and prints a formatted message
// to the console. This function can be expanded to include more
// complex greeting logic, such as time-based greetings (morning, evening),
// or localization support for multiple languages.
func Greet(user User) {
    fmt.Printf("Hello, %s! Welcome to our service.\n", user.Name)
}

// CalculateSum computes the sum of two integers and returns the result.
// It is a simple utility function that adds two numbers together.
// This function can be used in scenarios where you need to perform basic
// arithmetic operations, and it could be extended for more complex math
// operations if necessary.
func CalculateSum(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

func main() {
    // Example of using the User struct and Greet function.
    user := User{ID: 1, Name: "Alice"}
    Greet(user)

    // Example of using the CalculateSum function.
    sum := CalculateSum(10, 20)
    fmt.Printf("Sum: %d\n", sum)
}
```

## Key Elements of Multi-line Documentation

1. **Start with a brief summary** on the first line. This will appear in GoDoc, so it should be succinct and give the reader an idea of what the constant, type, or function is doing.
2. **Expand with further details** if necessary. After the first line, you can add more information, such as context, limitations, or intended use cases for constants and functions.

3. **Be clear and concise**: Avoid unnecessary verbosity, but do provide enough detail for the reader to understand how and when to use the constant, type, or function.

## Notes

- **GoDoc** will automatically format these multi-line docstrings correctly, making it easy for developers to understand the code's purpose and usage directly from the documentation.
- For longer comments or when describing complex logic, always use a new line for each part of the explanation.
